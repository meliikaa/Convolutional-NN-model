# Convolutional-NN-model
# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application

Welcome! In this project, you will dive into the fascinating world of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and their practical applications. This README file serves as your guide to understanding the project's objectives, prerequisites, and how to proceed.

## Project Overview

In this assignment, you'll work on two key tasks:

1. **Creating a Mood Classifier using TensorFlow Keras Sequential API:** You will build a model to classify the mood of individuals in images. Specifically, the model will determine whether the people in the images are smiling or not. The Happy House dataset containing images of people's faces will be used for this task.

2. **Building a Convolutional Neural Network for Sign Language Digit Recognition using TensorFlow Keras Functional API:** You'll construct a ConvNet that can identify sign language digits. This task is essential for sign language recognition.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this assignment, you'll gain the following skills and knowledge:

- Build and train ConvNets in TensorFlow for both binary and multiclass classification problems.
- Understand the different use cases for the TensorFlow Keras Sequential and Functional APIs in neural network modeling.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this assignment, it's important to have a solid understanding of TensorFlow. 


## Conclusion

This project will equip you with valuable skills in building and training ConvNets for various image classification tasks using TensorFlow. As you progress through the assignment, you'll gain insights into different modeling approaches, which will enhance your understanding of neural networks.

Best of luck with your assignment, and enjoy the journey into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the course instructors or the community for support. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–ðŸ“¸ðŸ§ ðŸŒŸ
